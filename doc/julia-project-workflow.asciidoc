= Julia Project Workflow

This page details how to set up and install packages for a Julia project directly from the command
line without dealing with any REPLs (read–eval–print loops).

== Setting up Project

When you first set up a project, you need to create Project.toml and Manifest.toml. `+Pkg.activate(pwd())+`
and `+Pkg.instantiate()+` will create those two files in the current working directory; technically
the Project.toml file is created after running `+Pkg.activate+` and after you install the first package.


`+julia -e "using Pkg; Pkg.activate(pwd()); Pkg.instantiate()"+`


The `+-e+` option evaluates the expression.


== Installing Packages

To install a Julia package, use the https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/[Pkg] package
manager.


`+julia --project=. -e "using Pkg; Pkg.add([\"Plots\", \"DataFrames\", \"CSV\"])"+`


Remember to escape the quotes.
